    "text": "I am a Master’s student in Business Analytics at Monash University, with a strong foundation in Mathematics (B.Sc. Hons.) from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, one of India’s most prestigious institutions. My academic training has shaped my love for exploring the logic behind data analysis formulas and designing frameworks to transform raw information into clear, actionable insights.\nI am passionate about applying analytics to solve practical problems, and I aim to pursue a career as a Business Analyst or one day build a venture of my own where I can combine creativity with data-driven decision-making. More than coding, I enjoy analysing data structures, breaking problems into formulas, and developing meaningful solutions.\nOutside my studies, I enjoy running a casual food blog, where I share my recipes and experiment with flavors. I am also actively involved in social work, particularly teaching underprivileged children, an experience that has been both humbling and rewarding."
